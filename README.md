# What is this?
This is a wannabe game  
only to do one thing, be able to make rust (the game) in rust (the programming language)
# what am i going to use?
### great that you asked little fellow!
for this i will be using Fyrox, a game engine solely built in rust (its not cheating trust)
# Will I be able to play it?
### YES! probably? maybe?
i still have think on if my soleless copy would even be enjoyable or function (along with a bunch of other problems)
